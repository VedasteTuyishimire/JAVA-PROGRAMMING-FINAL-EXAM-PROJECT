Hospitality Portal Management System (Java Swing)
📌 Project Overview

The Portal Management System is a Java Swing–based desktop application designed to manage hotel or service-based operations efficiently. The system supports core functionalities such as user authentication, room management, reservations, services, invoices, and staff handling, all integrated with a database for persistent data storage.

This project demonstrates the use of Java Swing for GUI development, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and JDBC for database connectivity.

Implementation Overview

Each system module is implemented as an independent Java class, ensuring modularity and maintainability. Database operations are centralized through the database connection class, allowing consistent and secure data handling.

9. Testing and Evaluation

System testing was conducted using:

Unit testing for individual modules

Integration testing to validate interactions between components

Functional testing to verify system requirements

Test results confirm that the system performs as intended and meets the defined objectives.

10. Results and Discussion

The developed system successfully automates portal management activities, reduces manual workload, and improves operational accuracy. The use of Java Swing provides an intuitive user interface, while database integration ensures data reliability and security.

11. Limitations

The system is limited to desktop platforms

Single-user access at a time

No online or cloud-based synchronization

12. Future Enhancements

Web-based or mobile application integration

Multi-user and role-based access control

Enhanced reporting and analytics

Integration with payment gateways

13. Conclusion

The Hopitality Portal Management System demonstrates the practical application of software engineering principles in solving real-world management challenges. The project highlights the effectiveness of Java Swing and JDBC in developing reliable desktop applications.
